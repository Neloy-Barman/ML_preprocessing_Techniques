I took an dataset called "Turkish Music Emotion Dataset Data Set" 
which is available at "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Turkish+Music+Emotion+Dataset"
Now this dataset consists of columns that are of numeric datatypes except the "Class" column.
We have to normalize the column values by placing the values in between 0 and 1. 

N.B: - Whatever we do here is always column wise. 

To normalize, 
  1. I at first subtracted the mean from each instances and
     then divide the resultant value by standard deviation.
  2. Then I subtracted the min from the instance and then divide it by
     difference of the max and min value of the column.
  3. As a result, all the values are now normalized and in between 0 and 1.
  
 I kept the resultant dataset in "N_Music_Emotion.csv" file.
